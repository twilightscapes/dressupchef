Hi, I'm Todd and I'm a photographer who turned into a web geek who turned back into a photographer.

In doing so, I've learned to meld the technical side of things along with the more creative aspects.

I've strived to bring the power of simple, fast and flexible websites with features that are designed for photographers, by a photographer.
